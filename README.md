# UWSO to Table Converter

The UWSO to Table Converter is a straightforward application that converts data from the Surface Observations section of Wyoming Weather Web into a CSV file, making subsequent data analysis easier.

## The project

The project was built at the request of a university friend who worked with data from the Wyoming Weather Web and had to select the data one by one, copying and pasting each value, wasting a lot of time in this data processing phase.

It was built using Bootstrap, my first project using it, and TypeScript, because I wanted to use Object-Oriented Programming to solve this problem and learn and apply the language. Although it uses Node.js, the project was built to work as a simple static site hosted on GitHub Pages. Node.js was mostly used to install the packages and to learn how to use it myself.

Overall, it was a project with a lot of learning, as I used Bootstrap, TypeScript and Node.js in a project for the first time.
